            </header>
            It is not easy to start! There was always an excuse or something else, very urgent, coming up, before I made
            my first step. Was it my subconsciousness checking out if I really want it? Or was it pure fear? But fear of
            what? Failure? If you don’t start, you will never know!

            <h2 class="cambridge-blue-header">Inspiration</h2>
            So I’ve started. But it would not be possible without her. Katarzyna. My main motivation! Knowing her path
            and history, I was drawing my inspiration from her. In my weakest moments I always thought about her and her
            strength. And that I don’t want to disappoint her!

            <h2>First steps and first mistakes</h2>
            I follow Katarzyna’s advice. My first challenge is to finish WTF course od edu.devstyle portal. I have to
            say I enjoy the way our “teacher” explains This New World to us. One really does not have to have ANY
            experience in the field to follow Maciek and his instructions. My first bitter lesson learned – he is
            absolutely right about making notes! NOTES! Just few days passed between I have watched the video and
            finally found time to do my homework of “Week 2”. I sat down, opened my computer and – sat still – how was I
            supposed to start…?

            Rewatching. Making notes. I will make notes, will note even the tiniest details. I know that once you get
            the gist of it, those steps just flow in your blood. But right now, I need to note everything! I am about to
            do my homework and continue with Week 3. Keep your fingers crossed for me!
            <p>
                Ok, homework done - and here one can see a small sample of it!
